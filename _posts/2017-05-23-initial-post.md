Dazzled by the hyperreality of digital journalism, we may find ourselves questioning 
the possibility of truth among contradictory narratives and sensations.  

British MP Jo Cox's death in June 2016 has represented such scenario most 
archetypally - with an extraordinary display of media bias provided by 
the so-called 'left' to 'right', from national newspaper to independent media.

In this work, we aim to create an user-experience on robotic journalism. Audiences 
can map out and generate news with artificial intelligence and data mined from a 
range of UK medias online by using a mixer interface.

The result will be displayed in an installation composed of data visualization, a 
ticker and research material.
